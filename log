	need to be able to resize mutiple row/col if resize event occur under multiselection 
	
	multiple row/col resize to fit content

# 20190328
	Cursor tracer currently cannot manage cross view selection correctly if parent widget is not at neutral scroll position

	sorting and filtering on columns is currently not avaliable

	# data conditional theming is currently not avaliable(fixed)

# 20190329
	implemnting data conditional themeing by changing QAbstractTableModel to QStandardItemModel with theming deligates
	super buggy, though basic row col add/removing still works.
