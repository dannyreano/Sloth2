	need to be able to resize mutiple row/col if resize event occur under multiselection 
	
	multiple row/col resize to fit content

# 20190328
	Cursor tracer currently cannot manage cross view selection correctly if parent widget is not at neutral scroll position

	sorting and filtering on columns is currently not avaliable

	# data conditional theming is currently not avaliable(fixed)
	# 	|> see 20190329

# 20190329
	implemnting data conditional themeing by changing QAbstractTableModel to QStandardItemModel with theming deligates
	super buggy, though basic row col add/removing still works.

	add new data item to solve data parsing issue, add data type judgement and will show data type using little triangle
	at the corner of the cell, currently this function not supported in freeze view.
